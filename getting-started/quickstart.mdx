---

## Step 1: Make Your First API Call

Let's trigger a CI job in your workspace using a [POST request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods):

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X POST "https://{your-workspace}.neetoci.com/api/external/v1/ci-jobs/trigger" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "project_name": "your-project-name",
    "branch_name": "main",
    "workflow_name": "playwright-staging"
  }'
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://{your-workspace}.neetoci.com/api/external/v1/ci-jobs/trigger",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "X-Api-Key": "your-api-key",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      project_name: "your-project-name",
      branch_name: "main",
      workflow_name: "playwright-staging"
    })
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests
import json

url = "https://{your-workspace}.neetoci.com/api/external/v1/ci-jobs/trigger"
headers = {
    "X-Api-Key": "your-api-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
payload = {
    "project_name": "your-project-name",
    "branch_name": "main",
    "workflow_name": "playwright-staging"
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

```php PHP
<?php
$curl = curl_init();

$payload = json_encode([
    "project_name" => "your-project-name",
    "branch_name" => "main",
    "workflow_name" => "playwright-staging"
]);

curl_setopt_array($curl, [
    CURLOPT_URL => "https://{your-workspace}.neetoci.com/api/external/v1/ci-jobs/trigger",
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_POST => true,
    CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => $payload,
    CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => [
        "X-Api-Key: your-api-key",
        "Content-Type: application/json"
    ],
]);

$response = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close($curl);

$data = json_decode($response, true);
print_r($data);
?>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `your-workspace` with your actual workspace subdomain,
  `your-api-key` with your generated API key, and
  `your-project-name` with the name of your project in NeetoCI.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Understanding the Response

A successful response will look like this [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format:

```json
{
  "ci_job": {
    "id": "169bf1ed-cc65-471f-b9f3-4f63f32b9400",
    "created_at": "2025-08-22T12:54:49.049Z",
    "status": "pending",
    "parallelism": 4,
    "url": "https://neetozone.neetoci.com/projects/neeto-record-web/jobs/169bf1ed-cc65-471f-b9f3-4f63f32b9400",
    "workflow": {
      "is_cypress": true,
      "name": "playwright-staging",
      "plan": {
        "id": "be8e68a3-2f79-4be8-86f1-11dfcfac8040",
        "capacity": 50,
        "cpu": 4.0,
        "memory": 8.0,
        "name": "Professional 2",
        "price": 4.0,
        "slug": "professional-2",
        "created_at": "2023-08-16T19:14:11.595Z",
        "updated_at": "2023-08-16T19:14:11.595Z",
        "ephemeral_storage": 80.0
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes:
- **`id`**: Unique identifier for the triggered CI job
- **`status`**: Current status (pending, running, completed, failed)
- **`url`**: Direct link to monitor the job in the NeetoCI dashboard
- **`workflow`**: Details about the executed workflow and its execution plan
