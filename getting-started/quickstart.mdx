## Step 1: Make Your First API Call

Let's retrieve all bookings in your workspace using a [GET request](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP#Request_methods):

<CodeGroup>
```bash curl
curl -X GET "https://{your-workspace}.neetocal.com/api/external/v1/bookings" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  "https://{your-workspace}.neetocal.com/api/external/v1/bookings",
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      "X-Api-Key": "your-api-key",
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
  }
);

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

```python Python
import requests

url = "https://{your-workspace}.neetocal.com/api/external/v1/bookings"
headers = {
    "X-Api-Key": "your-api-key",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
data = response.json()
print(data)
```

```php PHP
<?php
$curl = curl_init();

curl_setopt_array($curl, [
    CURLOPT_URL => "https://{your-workspace}.neetocal.com/api/external/v1/bookings",
    CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => true,
    CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER => [
        "X-Api-Key: your-api-key",
        "Content-Type: application/json"
    ],
]);

$response = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close($curl);

$data = json_decode($response, true);
print_r($data);
?>
```

</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  Replace `your-workspace` with your actual workspace subdomain and
  `your-api-key` with your generated API key.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Understanding the Response

A successful response will look like this [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format:

```json
{
  "bookings": [
    {
      "id": "booking-123",
      "sid": "abc123",
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "host_name": "Jane Smith",
      "host_email": "jane@example.com",
      "starts_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "ends_at": "2024-01-15T11:00:00Z",
      "time_zone": "America/New_York",
      "status": "confirmed",
      "created_at": "2024-01-10T15:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-01-10T15:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "total_records": 1,
    "total_pages": 1,
    "current_page_number": 1,
    "page_size": 30
  }
}
```
