## Error Response Format

When an error occurs, the API returns a JSON response with error details:

```json Error Response Example
{
  "message": "The provided API key is invalid or expired"
}
```

<ResponseField name='error.message' type='string'>
  A human-readable error message
</ResponseField>

<Tip>
  When debugging API issues, the [HTTP status
  code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) often provides
  the first clue about what went wrong. Start by checking the status code before
  diving into the response body.
