## Overview

The NeetoCI API uses standard [HTTP status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status) to indicate the success or failure of API requests.

## Success Responses

### 200 OK
The request was successful. The response body contains the requested data.

**Example**: Successfully triggered a CI job
```json
{
  "message": "CI job triggered successfully",
  "job_id": "ci-job-12345",
  "status": "queued"
}
```

## Client Error Responses

### 400 Bad Request
The request was malformed or contains invalid parameters.

**Common causes**:
- Missing required fields in request body
- Invalid data types
- Malformed JSON

**Example**:
```json
{
  "error": "Missing required field: branch_name"
}
```

### 401 Unauthorized
Authentication failed. Check your API key.

**Common causes**:
- Missing API key header
- Invalid or expired API key
- Incorrect workspace subdomain

**Example**:
```json
{
  "error": "Could not authenticate, invalid API Key"
}
```

### 403 Forbidden
The request was understood but the server is refusing to authorize it.

**Common causes**:
- Insufficient permissions for the requested action
- API key doesn't have access to the specified project

### 404 Not Found
The requested resource was not found.

**Common causes**:
- Invalid project name
- Invalid workflow name
- Non-existent branch

### 429 Too Many Requests
Rate limit exceeded. Try again later.

## Server Error Responses

### 500 Internal Server Error
An unexpected error occurred on the server.

**What to do**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- If the problem persists, contact support

### 502 Bad Gateway
The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.

### 503 Service Unavailable
The service is temporarily unavailable.

**What to do**:
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check the NeetoCI status page for any ongoing issues

## Handling Errors

Always check the HTTP status code and handle errors appropriately in your application:

```javascript
const response = await fetch(url, options);

if (!response.ok) {
  const errorData = await response.json();
  console.error(`Error ${response.status}:`, errorData.error);

  if (response.status === 401) {
    // Handle authentication error
  } else if (response.status === 400) {
    // Handle validation error
  } else if (response.status === 429) {
    // Handle rate limiting
  }
} else {
  const data = await response.json();
  // Process successful response
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair use. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 response. Wait before making additional requests.
