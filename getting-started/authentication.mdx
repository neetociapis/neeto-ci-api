### Generating an API Key

To use the NeetoCal APIs, you must first generate an API key.
[Learn how to generate your API key here.](https://help.neetocal.com/articles/api-keys)

### Making Authenticated API Requests

To authenticate your API requests, include a valid API key in the X-Api-Key header.

```bash
curl https://spinkart.neetocal.com/api/external/v1/me \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: your-api-key'
  --H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Header Format

Include your API key in the `X-Api-Key` header of every request:

```http
X-Api-Key: your_api_key_here
```

<Tip>
  Generate separate API keys for different workspaces. An API key generated in
  one workspace will not work in another.
</Tip>

## Security Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title='Keep Keys Secret' icon='eye-slash'>
    Never expose API keys in client-side code, public repositories, or logs
  </Card>
  <Card title='Use Environment Variables' icon='server'>
    Store API keys in environment variables or secure configuration files
  </Card>
  <Card title='Rotate Keys Regularly' icon='rotate'>
    Periodically generate new API keys and revoke old ones
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
  API keys provide access to sensitive data. Treat them like passwords and
  follow security best practices.
</Warning>

## Environment Variables

Store your API key as an environment variable:

<CodeGroup>
```bash .env
NEETOCAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
NEETOCAL_WORKSPACE=yourworkspace
```

```javascript JavaScript
// Load from environment
const apiKey = process.env.NEETOCAL_API_KEY;
const workspace = process.env.NEETOCAL_WORKSPACE;
```

```python Python
import os

api_key = os.getenv('NEETOCAL_API_KEY')
workspace = os.getenv('NEETOCAL_WORKSPACE')
```

</CodeGroup>

## Error Responses

### 401 Unauthorized

If your API key is missing, invalid, or expired, you'll receive a 401 error:

```json
{
  "error": "Could not authenticate, invalid API Key"
}
```

### Common Authentication Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Invalid API Key'>
    **Problem**: API key is missing or invalid <br />
    **Solution**: Verify your API key is correct and hasn't been revoked/expired
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Incorrect workspace subdomain'>
    **Problem**: Subdomain is left as the default value (**spinkart**) or
    incorrect
    <br />
    **Solution**: Verify your subdomain name is properly added in the request
    URL
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to [rate limiting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_limiting) to ensure fair use. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a 429 response. If you encounter this error try again after some time.
