## What is a subdomain?

A subdomain is the part of your workspace URL that comes before the main domain. For example, in the URL:

```
https://spinkart.neetoci.com
```

The subdomain is: **spinkart**

This subdomain is crucial for making API requests, as it identifies your specific workspace within NeetoCI.

## Step-by-step instructions
<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate your workspace URL">
    You can usually find this in your browser's address bar when logged into your workspace.

    Example:
    ```
    https://your-workspace-subdomain.neetoci.com
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify the main domain">
    Our main domain is: `neetoci.com`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Extract the part before the main domain">
    Everything before `neetoci.com` is your subdomain.

    **Example:**
    - URL: `https://marketing.neetoci.com`
    - Subdomain: `marketing`
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Your Subdomain in API Requests

Once you've identified your subdomain, you'll use it in all API requests. The base URL format is:

```
https://{your-subdomain}.neetoci.com/api/external/v1
```

For example, if your subdomain is `mycompany`, your API base URL would be:

```
https://mycompany.neetoci.com/api/external/v1
```

## Common Examples

Here are some common subdomain patterns:

| Type       | Example URL                           | Subdomain        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Company    | `https://acmecorp.neetoci.com`       | `acmecorp`       |
| Department | `https://marketing.neetoci.com`      | `marketing`      |
| Project    | `https://product-launch.neetoci.com` | `product-launch` |
