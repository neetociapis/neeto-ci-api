## What is a Subdomain?

A subdomain is the part of your workspace URL that comes before the main domain. For example, in the URL:

```
https://spinkart.neetocal.com
```

The subdomain is: **spinkart**

This subdomain is crucial for making API requests, as it identifies your specific workspace within NeetoCal.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Locate your workspace URL

You can usually find this in your browser's address bar when logged into your workspace.

Example:

```
https://your-workspace-subdomain.neetocal.com
```

### 2. Identify the main domain

Our main domain is: `neetocal.com`

### 3. Extract the part before the main domain

Everything before `neetocal.com` is your subdomain.

**Example:**

- URL: `https://marketing.neetocal.com`
- Subdomain: `marketing`

## Using Your Subdomain in API Requests

Once you've identified your subdomain, you'll use it in all API requests. The base URL format is:

```
https://{your-subdomain}.neetocal.com/api/external/v1
```

For example, if your subdomain is `mycompany`, your API base URL would be:

```
https://mycompany.neetocal.com/api/external/v1
```

## Common Examples

Here are some common subdomain patterns:

| Type       | Example URL                           | Subdomain        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Company    | `https://acmecorp.neetocal.com`       | `acmecorp`       |
| Department | `https://marketing.neetocal.com`      | `marketing`      |
| Project    | `https://product-launch.neetocal.com` | `product-launch` |
