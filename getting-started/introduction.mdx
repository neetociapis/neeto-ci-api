## API overview

The NeetoCI API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) principles and uses standard [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) response codes. All API endpoints return [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) responses and require authentication via API keys.

Before you start with NeetoCI APIs you will need the following:

1. [A NeetoCI workspace](/getting-started/identifying-subdomain).
2. [An API key](/getting-started/authentication).
